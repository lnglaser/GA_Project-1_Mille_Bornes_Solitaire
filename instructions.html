      <h1>Mille Bornes Solitaire</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Mille Bornes Solitaire! This is a single-player version of a
        game published in France in the 1960s, and brought to America by Parker
        Brothers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The object of the game is to complete a trip of exactly 1000 miles. You
        do this by playing miles to your score, and by dealing with various
        hazards and obstacles one would encounter on the road.
      </p>

      <h2>Game Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mileage cards - 200 (x4), 100 (x12), 75 (x10), 50 (x10), 25 (x10)
        </li>
        <li>
          Hazard cards - Red light (x5), Out of gas (x3), Flat tire (x3),
          Accident (x3)
        </li>
        <li>
          Remedy cards - Green light (x14), Gas (x6), Spare tire (x6), Repairs
          (x6)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The game cards are dealt into two decks - the player receives a deck
          containing all the mileage and remedy cards, while the computer
          receives a deck containing all the hazard cards. The player is dealt
          six cards from their deck, and then one more card is drawn.
        </li>

        <li>
          The player has a battle pile and a score counter. Remedies and hazards
          are played to the battle pile, and miles to the score. Only the top
          card on the battle pile is ever in effect.
        </li>

        <li>
          The battle pile will be started with a Green light card. Miles can
          only be played while the Green light card is on top of the battle
          pile.
        </li>

        <li>
          On your turn, after drawing a card from the draw pile you may:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Play mileage cards to your score (if your battle pile shows a
              Green light)
            </li>
            <li>Discard a card</li>
            <li>Play a remedy card over a hazard card on your battle pile</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Each type of remedy will only remove one type of hazard. The hazards
          and associated remedies are:
          <ul>
            <li>Red light, remedied by Green light</li>
            <li>Out of gas, remedied by Gas</li>
            <li>Flat tire, remedied by Spare tire</li>
            <li>Accident, remedied by Repairs</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that even after playing an appropriate remedy on a hazard, you
          must then play a Green light card on your next turn before you can
          play any more mileage cards.
        </li>
        <li>
          That's it! If you get to exactly 1000 miles before you run out of
          turns, you win! Grab your keys, put on your best driving gloves, and
          let's motor!
        </li>
