    <h1>Mille Bornes Solitaire</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Mille Bornes Solitaire! This is a single-player version of a game published in France in the 1960's, and brought to America by Parker Brothers.</p>

    <p>The object of the game is to complete a trip of exactly 1000 miles. You do this by playing miles to your score, and by dealing with various hazards and obstacles one would encounter on the road.</p>

<h2>Game Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mileage cards - 200 (x4), 100 (x12), 75 (x10), 50 (x10), 25 (x10)</li>
    <li>Hazard cards - Red light (x5), Out of gas (x3), Flat tire (x3), Accident (x3)</li>
    <li>Remedy cards - Green light (x14), Gas (x6), Spare tire (x6), Repairs (x6)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The game cards are dealt into two decks - the player receives a deck containing all the mileage and hazard cards, while the computer receives a deck containing all the hazard cards. The player is dealt six cards from their deck, and then one more card is drawn.</li>

    <li>The player has a battle pile and a score counter. Remedies and hazards are played to the battle pile, and miles to the score. Only the top card on the battle pile is ever in effect.</li>

    <li>The player must first play a "Green light" card onto the battle pile, either drawn directly from the deck, or from their hand. Miles can only be played while the Green light card is on top of the battle pile.</li>
